          "Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants within the Cannabaceae family. A native of Asia, Cannabis has been naturalized and cultivated worldwide over thousands of years. Traditionally, three major classes have been recognized: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. We are going to discus the main physical differences between these 3 classes"

          "Capable of towering over six metres in height, the sativa species is native to tropical climates, where long periods of intense sunlight are the norm. This adaptation to its environment has allowed the sativa species to develop large pointed leaves with minimal markings or patterns. Their branches are outstretched with 3–6 inches between nodes."

          "Sativa strains are capable of dealing with higher concentrations of humidity compared to their indica counterparts. However, sativas have a longer flowering time, with plenty of space needed for them to reach their full potential. Cultivating the sativa subspecies requires a knowledgeable hand, and a carefully prepared growing environment or greenhouse."

Sativas are not the first choice for medical markets, unless dealing with specific medical conditions. Sativa-dominant strains are an ideal choice for the recreational food and drink market. "

Leaves are also smaller, with broader, slightly marbled fingers. Grown correctly, indica strains resemble a small Christmas tree, with the largest leaves at the base of the plant."

They are usually the preferred option for recreational growers as they have a shorter flowering period. This means that in controlled environments (indoor grow room) it is possible to harvest multiple times per year."

They do not grow very tall, only reaching up to four feet in height. Native to central and eastern Europe and Asia, the ruderalis subspecies has become adept at thriving in poor, or hostile environments."

        sub: "Growing characteristics",
        content:
          "The fundamental difference between ruderalis and sativa or indica is how the subspecies flowers. Usually, a cannabis plant would use the change in seasons to prompt the shift from the vegetative phase to flowering. However, due to the lower sunlight intensity in Europe, the ruderalis subspecies has developed an inbuilt timer for flowering—regardless of seasonal changes. Its genetics determine the length of time it spends in the vegetative stage before automatically flowering."

They are not used in the recreational market due to their rather poor return, although they can be cross-bred with either indica or sativa strains to improve yields. The ruderalis subspecies can contain higher levels of CBD and be useful for medicinal markets, as long as sophisticated extraction equipment is used. The fibrous stems also make ruderalis strains more suitable for use in clothing, or textiles."

          "A term you will likely find when shopping for seeds is “Autoflower”  but what actually does this mean? An Autoflower seed is a cross bread of either a C. Sativa, C. Indica or a hybrid strain with the C. Ruderalis. This crossing of genes results in a plant that generates the bud quality of an C. Indica/Sativa but adopts the inbuilt timer for flowering characteristic of the Ruderalis. When growing Autoflowers you can expect a fast growing plant that goes from seed to harvest in as little as 8 weeks without worrying to much about controling the light cycles. Also because of its fast cycle there is less time for mistakes which make it a easier to grow variant for beginners."

          "Since ancient times various parts of the Cannabis plant have provided food, medicine, clothing, paper, fuel, building materials and more to humanity. Hemp is possibly one of the earliest plants to be cultivated. Cannabis was a widely prescribed folk medicine in Europe and the Americas prior to the age of synthetic pharmaceuticals and still figures in the religious practices of some cultures. Hemp use archaeologically dates back to the Neolithic Age in China, with hemp fiber imprints found on Yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium BC. The Chinese later used hemp to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. In fact, from around 2000 BCE until 1883 Cannabis was amongst the largest agricultural crops on the planet, and ranked highly in medications globally during this period. Around 1910 these traditional uses came under political pressure initiated by the American, British, Egyptian and South African governments. In the middle of the 20th century, international coordination led to sweeping restrictions on cannabis throughout most of the globe. Entering the 21st century, some nations began to change their approaches to cannabis, with measures taken to decriminalize cannabis."
